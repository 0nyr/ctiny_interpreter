I have a concrete context-free grammar in EBNF form. I want to create a parser in Rust for this grammar. The goal of the parser is just to check whether or not an input program is valid. In case of mistake, the parser should give the line of the error, as well as what is the error. How can I build such a basic parser in Rust ?

Started working on the Rust code. I just set up the basics of the program like CLI and pipelines.

Started working on the project. I created my personal version of Ctiny, following what was described as Tiny and doing some design choices.
