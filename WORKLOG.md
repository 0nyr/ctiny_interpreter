# WORKLOG

* [ ] Add symbol table to be able to recognize if an identifier is defined or not ! This sould ensure `cargo run -- -p syntax-parsing -f res/invalid/invalid_program_c.ctiny` detects the unknown identifier `a` at line 6.
* [ ] Add type system with overflow checking
* [ ] Correct the .txt grammar with modifications done inside .pest PEG file.

### Mon 17 Jul 2023

Started to work on interpretation. I'm starting with expression interpretation.

* [ ] Complete ``get_variable_value``
* [ ] Complete `interpret_expression`
* [ ] Test `interpret_expression`

### Sun 16 Jul 2023

I added the static symbol table.

I also made a PR on Pest that was merged into `master`. This PR introduce the possibility to merge Spans, which was crucial in building BinaryExpression.

* [X] Now that we have the AST and Static Symbol Table, it's time to head towards interpreting the code.

I have a problem with spans... I want to use pest spans... but their are immutable and it's impossible to merge two spans... This is a real problem...

I have 2 options... either I drop spans completly... not ideal, lot of rework needed... debugging very hard...

Or I declare my own mutable span... But I will need to find a way to pass the input string reference all around... The best would be a king of global variable. Ugly but no need to pass it on every function params...

Otherwise I will need to pass that to every function that need to build a Node... o_O...

I stayed quite a while on anoying bugs

* operator left-to-right order of pest, for `relation_operator = { "<=" | ">=" | "<" | ">" }`
* macro invocation, forgetting the `;` after macro call inside a function, causing rust to try to return the code generated by the macro as the last expression of a function in rust is an implicit return.

I worked well, 8h30 today on the project, but the statements are still unfinished so I'm a bit disapointed.

Need to debug statements with empty ";" following symbols...

### Wed 5 Jul 2023

Removing block from statements, which simplifies things a lot.

Heavy refactoring for simplifying the grammar and preparing the AST building process.

### Mon 3 Jul 2023

Added full syntax-parsing using `pest`.

I added comments and made some corrections to the grammar. I had made some mistake in function parameters and declarations that lead to ambiguities.

The `syntax_parsing` pipeline is able to perform full tokenization. Symbol table is missing though, so undefine identifier errors are not handled yet.

### Sat 1 Jul 2023

Started working on the Rust code. I just set up the basics of the program like CLI and pipelines.

### Fri 30 Jun 2023

Started working on the project. I created my personal version of Ctiny, following what was described as Tiny and doing some design choices.
